## 🧠 My Learning Mission:

I'm focused on mastering the **Modern Web Application Stack** by building small, practical tools useful for Program/Product Managers.

### 🛠️ Currently Dabbling In:

* **AI Integrations:** Building prototypes for automated AI-driven tools for PMs.
* **TypeScript (TS):** Writing more robust, maintainable application logic.
* **Next.js / React / Tailwind CSS:** Mastering full-stack, rapid UI development and styling.

### 🚀 Featured Experiments:

* **[Project Link]: User Stories Spark** (Next.js, OpenAI API)
<!--
