## 🧠 My Learning Mission:

I'm focused on mastering the **Modern Web Application Stack** by building small, practical tools useful for Program/Product Managers.

* **AI API Integration:** Building prototypes for automated AI-driven tools for PMs.
* **TypeScript (TS):** Writing more robust, maintainable application logic.
* **Next.js / React / Tailwind CSS:** Mastering full-stack, rapid UI development and styling.
    

### 🚀 Featured Projects:

* **[User Story Spark](https://user-stories-ai.vercel.app/):** AI-driven tool helping PMs craft user stories that spark joy.
